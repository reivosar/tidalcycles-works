3. **Configure VSCode for TidalCycles**  
   Add the following configuration to your `settings.json` file:

   ```json
   {
       "tidalcycles.tidalPath": "/Users/<your-username>/.local/bin/tidal",
       "tidalcycles.sclangPath": "/Applications/SuperCollider.app/Contents/MacOS/sclang",
       "tidalcycles.ghciPath": "/usr/local/bin/ghci"
   }
   ```

   Replace `<your-username>` with your macOS username.

### Starting TidalCycles
